(defun-block-intro . 0)
(statement-block-intro . 8)
(substatement . 8)

You can access them by typing C-c C-o, but  must entered values as
- -- + ++ 0....  or enter numbers 2 4 8....
This works just for the secession.

You can also place your cursor on a line hit tab and find out
what the name of that variable is, like : syntax ((defunc-block-intro . 692 
)),  indent 4


Although the permanent to set them is the .emacs file below. This is an
example from emacs manual  page.... Browse manuals with info, choose cc-mode.
