  Student: Matthew Thomas
  Date: 3/16/2019

Summary:

This submission contains the files:
	README       -- this file, with answers to Q1 and Q3 of the assignment
	sttyl.c      -- main logic to process options and display "find" results
	Plan         -- design document for this assignment
	Makefile     -- the Makefile
	my_script.sh -- my sample test script, including a run of the lib215 script
	typescript   -- a sample run, performed using my_script.sh

Notes:
	My pfind program uses some ideas I learned/copied from previous assignments
	in Bruce's CSCI e26 class in the fall of 2018. Mainly, the idea of the
	file-scope variable "progname" to keep track of the program name
	("./pfind") to be used in helper functions that output messages to stderr
	and exit. Also, construct_path is a helper function that I modified from a
	"new_string" function I wrote/used in homeworks #4 and #5. For pfind, the
	function also performs the task of concatenating the parent and child
	strings; my original "new_string" function only malloc()ed memory and
	exit(1) if there was an error.
	
	I wrote my code using a combination of BBEdit on the Mac, and server-side
	editing using Emacs. Indentation is 4-space wide tabs. With 4-space tabs,
	all lines should be under 80-cols wide.
