Purpose:

The purpose of more03 is to extend the 'more02' version of more
by adding new features:

   [a] no need to press Enter to have program receive a keystroke
   [b] program will work in any size terminal window
   [c] program will work if window is resized when program is running

Ouline:

The program still has a main loop that reads the command line and processes
files named there.  If no files are named on the command line, the program
pages through data read from stdin.

For each file, the program shows one screenful of lines, then asks the user
what to do, reads a keystroke from the user.  Depending on the key pressed,
the program quits, shows one more line of text, or shows one more screenful
of text, then asks again.

Layering:

	main ,for each file, calls:
		do_more	-- which pages through a file calling
			how_much_more -- to ask user how much more to show

File Structure:

	more03.c	-- the main three functions listed above
	termfuncs.c	-- a toolkit that provides access to terminal info and input
