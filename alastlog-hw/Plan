Project: alastlog

Purpose: A program to display a list of last logins.

Outline:
	alastlog reads a lastlog file, defaults to /var/log/lastlog, and presents
	the contents in human-readable form, displaying the 
	
	alastlog 
	
Output:
	The output is fixed-width fields including Username, Port, From,
	and Latest columns. The latest login field is displayed with a time format
	of "Mon Dec 17 11:14:39 -0500 2018", as an example.
	
	alastlog uses read to get data from the file and uses printf to format and
	output results. 

Arguments:
	alastlog accepts three user options, -u, -t, and -f to specify a user, a
	date limit on entries, and a different data file respectively. The -u option
	requires a single username, the -t option requires a number, and the -f
	option requires a filename/path. If the -f option is not given, alastlog
	process the log file located at /var/log/lastlog, defined as LLOG_FILE in
	alastlog.c
	
Input:
	alastlog does not accept any user input. With the -f option, a user can
	specify a different lastlog file to use than the default /var/log/lastlog.

Data Structures:
        dumputmp reads and writes one record at a time.  It only needs
        to store a single record, so one variable of type struct utmp
        is used.
