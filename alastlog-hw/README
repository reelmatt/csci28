README for alastlog

  Student: Matthew Thomas
  Date: 2/16/2019

Summary:

  This submission contains the files:
	README		-- this file
	alastlog.c  -- main logic to process options and display lastlog contents
	lllib.c     -- library functions to open, close, read, and buffer lastlog
	lllib.h     -- header file for lllib
	Plan        -- design document for this assignment
	Makefile	-- the Makefile
	typescript  -- a sample run, including the lib215 test script
	
Notes:
	A lot of the code to implement buffering was copied from the sample files
	provided in this assignment, utmplib.c and utmp.h. These are the same as
	ones written in lecture #2 for implementing the who program. I modified
	the code to work with lastlog structs (as opposed to utmp structs), and
	added ll_seek() to assist with loading the buffer from the correct position.
	
	For buffering, I set the NRECS value to 512, but also tested with values of
	1, 2, 16, and 2048 to make sure the buffer worked properly. See my plan for 
	more on buffering, but the tl;dr is when loading a new buffer, it reads 
	NRECS in, with the requested record at the start of the index.
